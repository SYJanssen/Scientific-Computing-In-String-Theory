In this paper, the complexity and challenges for Scientifically approaching String Theory have been given. Options for Computationally falsifying String Theory have also been introduced. This can offer all types of scientists a new point of view for contributing in String Theory. String Theory is my personal favorite theory of physics and I love how the complexity makes the theory a little bit far fetched, but also very elegant because it's still very logical. I do believe that even the most elegant and logical hypotheses can be false and that's why we, scientists, need to keep an open mind. If we fix our mindset to much on one idea, we might lose track of the truth and lose time. String Theory is definitely a theory which should be inspected further, but maybe some competition between theories who may become a Theory of Everything would also be good for science.
