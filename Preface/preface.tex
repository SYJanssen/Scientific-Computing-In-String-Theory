In this paper, the functionality of Scientific Computing in String Theory will be discussed. Since String Theory is a very complex theory in physics, which hasn't theoretically been proven yet, it's very useful, if it could approached experimentally. This will never prove the theory completely, but it certainly can falsify the theory. In the end, there will be a conclusion on how Scientific Computing can be used for string theory and there will be recommendations to implement and further research
