In order to research Scientific Computing in String Theory even more, some examples of further research could be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel Computing in String Theory:
    It has already been discussed in this paper, however it's still very general. A more specific approach could be worked out in order to solve String Theory.
    \item Generalization of nearly identical manifolds:
    Since there are a lot of possibilities, a generalization for slightly different manifolds might be able lower the computational power necessary.
    \item Solve String Theory theoretically:
    However this is a very big step and especially a big leap of faith because we don't know yet, if String Theory has a great potential to be true, this is the best way to once and forever solve the problem which might lead to a Theory of Everything from which we can derive new insights in the beautiful world of physics.
\end{itemize}
